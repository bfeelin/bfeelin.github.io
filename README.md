This purpose of this leaderboard is to give recognition and visiblity to salespeople
framer-motion and react-countup were used to animate the leaderboard after a new sale was made
This demo increments a random persons data every 5 seconds to simulate a sale

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
